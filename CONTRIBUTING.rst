Some of them require in-depth knowledge about the technology in use.

Issues tagged with `good first issues <https://github.com/orgs/NordicSemiconductor/projects/2?card_filter_query=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_ are very small issues that are selected to be a great starting point in making yourself familiar with the codebase.
