ADR 005: Clean :file:`.gitignore`
#################################

A :file:`.gitignore` file in a project must only cover the artifacts caused by the contained source code and not those caused by the personal choice of editor or the environment of a developer.

This is explained in detail in the `Clean .gitignore files issue <https://github.com/coderbyheart/first-principles/issues/30>`_.
