ADR 004: Move to Nordic Semiconductor GitHub organization
#########################################################

In February 2021, the project was moved from the ``Bifravst`` GitHub organization to the official Nordic Semiconductor GitHub organization (``Nordic Semiconductor``).
This move was caused by the `promotion of the Bifravst project into an official Nordic Semiconductor open-source project <https://github.com/bifravst/bifravst/issues/56>`_ with the release of the firmware in `nRF Connect SDK <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf>`_ as `nRF9160: Asset Tracker v2 <https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/1.5.0/nrf/applications/asset_tracker_v2/README.html>`_ application.

The project is renamed to nRF Asset Tracker.
