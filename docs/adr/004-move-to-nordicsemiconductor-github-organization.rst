4. Move to Nordic Semiconductor GitHub organization
###################################################

In February 2021 the project is moved to the official Nordic Semiconductor GitHub organization (``NordicSemiconductor``) from the ``bifravst`` GitHub organization.
This move was caused by the `Bifravst project being promoted to an official Nordic Semiconductor open-source project <https://github.com/bifravst/bifravst/issues/56>`_ alongside with the release of the firmware in `nRF Connect SDK <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf>`_ as ``asset_tracker_v2`` application.

This includes a rename of the project to *nRF Asset Tracker*.
