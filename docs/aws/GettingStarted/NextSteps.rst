Next steps

*Congratulations!* You have finished the initial set-up of the *Asset Tracker Example for Cloud*.

This is all you need to do for now, some next interesting topics are:

* enabling :ref:`Cell Geolocation <aws-unwired-labs-api>`
* once you start modifying the firmware you should

   * set up :ref:`Continuous deployment <aws-continuous-deployment>`
   * and :ref:`Continuous integration of the cloud resources <aws-continuous-integration>`,
   * and even more advanced :ref:`of the firmware <aws-firmware-ci>`.

If you have feedback on how to improve this *Getting Started Guide*, please get in touch and share your ideas `on {DevZone <https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/search?q=AssetTrackerCloudExample#serpsort=date%20desc>`_ or `on GitHub <https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-docs>`_ ... we monitor these forums closely.
