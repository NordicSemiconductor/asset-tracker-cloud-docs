Next steps

*Congratulations!* You have finished the initial set-up of the *nRF Asset Tracker* cloud components.

This is all you need to do for now, some next interesting topics are:

* enabling :ref:`Cell Geolocation <aws-unwired-labs-api>`
* once you start modifying the firmware you should

   * set up :ref:`Continuous deployment <aws-continuous-deployment>`
   * and :ref:`Continuous integration of the cloud resources <aws-continuous-integration>`,
   * and even more advanced :ref:`of the firmware <aws-firmware-ci>`.
