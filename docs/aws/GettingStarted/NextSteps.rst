At this stage, you have completed the initial setup of the nRF Asset Tracker.
An interesting topic to explore is enabling Cell Geolocation using either :ref:`nRF Connect for Cloud <aws-nrf-connect-for-cloud-api>` or :ref:`Unwired Labs <aws-unwired-labs-api>`.

Once you start modifying the firmware, you can also look into the following topics:

* :ref:`Customizing the web application to show your sensor data <aws-customization>`
* Setting up :ref:`Continuous deployment <aws-continuous-deployment>`
* Performing :ref:`Continuous integration of the cloud resources <aws-continuous-integration>`
* Performing advanced :ref:`aws-firmware-ci`
