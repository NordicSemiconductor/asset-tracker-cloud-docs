   **ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§**

   The Azure implementation of the nRF Asset Tracker is work in progress.
   See `this issue <https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-docs/discussions/12>`_ for more information.

.. warning_end

The nRF Asset Tracker provides a reference implementation of a serverless backend for an IoT product using Azure.
It is developed using `Azure Resource Manager <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview>`_ in `TypeScript <https://www.typescriptlang.org/>`_.

The project also provides an easily understandable description of the available (and implemented) features, in a single folder called  `features <https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-azure-js/tree/saga/features>`_.

.. note::

   **Recurring costs**

   The Azure solution is using `Cosmos DB <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction>`_ for querying historical device data which costs around â‚¬25 per month.
   However, you can check if you are eligible for `the free tier for new accounts <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cosmos-db/>`_.

   The Azure solution is using `IoT Hub <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/>`_ with the S1 standard tier  which costs around â‚¬25 per month in order to use `Device Update for IoT Hub <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub-device-update/understand-device-update>`_.

   Hence the minimum costs to run nRF Asset Tracker on Azure is around â‚¬25-50 per month.
