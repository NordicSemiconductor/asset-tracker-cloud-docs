## About the System Overview Diagram

[GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) is used so the System Overview Diagram can be generate from [text source code](./system-overview.dot).
This allows to generate the same diagram quickly for different versions of the nRF Asset Tracker (they support different sets of cloud providers), and to provide hyperlinks from the diagram as well as ensuring that updates to the diagram (for e.g. module names, links to projects, third-party integrations) can be done without needing to manually update a diagram using a third-party graphics editing software.
