Direnv
######

`Direnv <https://direnv.net/>`_ locates the environment variables in a :file:`.envrc` file in the current folder and automatically exports them.
It is available as a plugin for most of the shells.

It is used to store the credentials and other configuration settings in *nRF Asset Tracker*.

.. note::

    You must add :file:`.envrc` files to your global `.gitignore file <https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files#create-a-global-gitignore>`_.
