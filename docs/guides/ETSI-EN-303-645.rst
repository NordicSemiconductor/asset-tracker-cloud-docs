#####################################################################

ETSI has released `ETSI EN 303 645 V2.1.1 <https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/press-releases/1789-2020-06-etsi-releases-world-leading-consumer-iot-security-standard>`_, which outlines 13 baseline requirements for secure consumer IoT devices:

* No universal default passwords.
* Implement a means to manage reports of vulnerabilities.
* Keep software updated.
* Securely store sensitive security parameters.
* Communicate securely.
* Minimize exposed attack surfaces.
* Ensure software integrity.
* Ensure that personal data is secure.
* Make systems resilient to outages.
* Examine system telemetry data.
* Make it easy for users to delete user data.
* Make installation and maintenance of devices easy.
* Validate input data.

Since more and more B2B IoT solutions are getting commoditized, these requirements apply to the commercial solutions also.
